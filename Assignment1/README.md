Instruction
What to do:
1. Find at least five poems or blocks of prose and run them through the functions. Try different settings and combinations for each function (20 random lines, then 5 random lines, or phasesThatBeginWith("and");). Then decide which process worked best (or worst!) for each text selection. Take a screenshot of the best or worst result for each.  (By best or worst, I mean most or least interesting or any way you want to interpret what you see on the screen--funny, strange, surprising, etc). Then, for each of the five texts, write a brief paragraph that names the text, why you selected it, describes what processes you tried, and says what you think of the results. Please rank the texts you chose from best to worst (that is, what text seemed best suited to this kind of inquiry, and what text didn't pan out). 
2. Write a final paragraph in which you propose two of your own functions for reading text. You will not be asked to program the function itself -- these are conceptual functions. The main questions is: After running these processes, what would be two other useful ways to interpret/sort/rearrange text? You can be as practical or imaginative as you want here--magical thinking, at this point, is allowed.
3. Read through the functions code in "textMachine.js". You may have trouble understanding all or any of it. That's ok! Save a copy of "textMachine.js" and then start breaking things. Change numbers or words, erase lines (or just comment them out). And run the program with Chrome's Javascript console open: look at the error message (you may not get one). Go back and fix it. It may be helpful for you to write comments about what you are changing, or duplicate lines and comment out the original. Select a function you are interested in, and break it: submit the broken code file and a screenshot of the error in the Javascript console  to canvas.

Deliverables (Upload to canvas by 1/28, 4PM):
1. 5 Screen Shots of the text output in the Browser: One for each text showing best or worst (most interesting or least interest) outputs from each of your text selections.
2. 1 page brief on selected texts, plus two proposed functions.
3. A broken version of "textMachine.js" plus a screenshot of the error in the Javascript console.

INSTRUCTIONS AND HINTS
Inputting your text selections (poem or prose block): You will need to transform the text into an array named "textArray" and put that array at the top the "textMachine.js" file. Luckily, I have written a program that does most of that for you. Go to:
http://floatingmedia.com/DataClass/arrayMaker.html
 (Links to an external site.)
Find your text, copy it and paste into the left window at "arrayMaker.html". Click on "Poem to Array" or "Prose to Array". In the right window, one long line of text will appear. That is your array with a properly named variable. Copy and paste it into "textMachine.js" (and make sure you erase or comment-out any other array named "textArray").
Running the program: 1. Be sure that "theTextMachine.html" and "textMachine.js" are in the same folder on your computer.
2. Open your Chrome browser.
3. Open up the Javascript console in Chrome (VIEW > DEVELOPER > JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE)
(If there are errors in the script, the console will tell you.)
4. Drag and drop "theTextMachine.html" into your Chrome window, you will get what we saw in class.
5. Keep your Chrome browser open.
6. Open both files in Sublime Text. 
7. Make changes and save changes in Sublime Text: 
a) Changing your text: This change happens by pasting your array into top of the textMachine.js file.
b) Changing the function calls: This happens in theTextMachine.html. You can change the numbers/values inside the function calls. Or you can comment-out function calls and see what happens. Read the comments I have written around each of these function calls, they tell you what kind of changes you can make
8. Save your changes in Sublime Text. Go to Chrome and press the reload button: you will see the results of the changes you made.
Repeat 7 & 8 many times. In Sublime Text you are editing the code, in Chrome you are running the code and viewing the results.
